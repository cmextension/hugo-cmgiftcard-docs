If you sell both physical and electronic gift card, you need to create 2 menu items for this menu item type. If you only sell one type of gift card, you only need to create 1 menu item for the gift card type you sell. If you don't want to show this menu item in your site's menus, you can create it in a hidden menu (a menu which is not assigned to any Joomla! menu module).

In gift card form, you can select the gift card designs which you have created for the selected gift card type.
