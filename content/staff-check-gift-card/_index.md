You may want to allow some people in your company (staff) to check for gift card information without giving them access to your Joomla!'s back-end.

To do this, you need to create Joomla! user accounts for your staff members, add these Joomla! users to the user group which you have selected for `Staff's User Group` option in CM Gift Card's configuration.

Create new menu items for `Check Gift Cards` and `Check Gift Card Detail (hidden menu item)` menu item types.

In your front-end, if you access the new menu item for `Check Gift Cards` as a regular user (the one who is not in Staff group), you will receive an error:

If you log in as a staff member, you can see all the gift cards and filter for the gift card you want to check the information.
