PayPal and Stripe payment gateways require your credentials to use their services, so you need to configure these plugins and enter your credentials (eg. API key) together with configuring other options like currency, live mode or test mode.

If you use Bank Transfer payment plugin, you can configure the message shown to clients after placing orders as well as enable sending emails to clients and site admins to notify about the orders. You can design the emails in [the Email Templates page](/email-templates)
