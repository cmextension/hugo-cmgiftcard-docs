* **Order Number's Starting Number**: Instead of starting from 1, the first order number on your site can be a custom number. For example, if you enter 2507 then the first order on your site will have order number 2507, the next one is 2508, 2509 and so on.
* **Gift Card Code's Type**: You can use your own codes as gift card codes or let CM Gift Card generates unique and random codes.
* **Gift Card Code's Length**: The maximum character quantity of gift card code. This affects both predefined code and random code.
* **Gift Card Code's Characters**: The types of characters allowed in gift card code. This affects both predefined code and random code.
* **When No Predefined Codes Left To Use**: If you use predefined code and all of your predefined codes are used already, we can switch to use random code or show an error and not allow customer to checkout.
